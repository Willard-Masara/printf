#Pertnership project [0x11. C - printf]
#Mendatory tasks
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
Write a function that produces output according to a format.
1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
Handle the following conversion specifiers:
d
i
You donâ€™t have to handle the length modifier.
=======
This is a README for our collaborative project. The project will be done in these steps:
1. we have to have a file to handle our prototypes. Will call ours our_header.h---turns  out they want us to call it main.h, so we will comply accordingly!
2. we have to have a file with the implementation of the functions, your main.c but will call ours our_functions.c
3. the third file has to have our function definitions. The compilation will only be possible when these files are linked by referencing "our_header.h" within our_functions.c 
4. while we have the prototype for printf, we need to add our own definition of printf so will have a prototype int our_printf(const char *format, ... ). It follows therefore that our_header.h will have this prototype!
5. The tricky part is having to handle the different format specifiers within our_printf fuction, but it can be done, one case at a time!
6. Luleko and Willard.
